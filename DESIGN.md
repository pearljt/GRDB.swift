The Design of GRDB.swift
========================

More than caveats or defects, there are a few glitches, or surprises in the GRDB.swift API. We try to explain them here. And eventually, explanations may lead to solutions :-)


- **Why is RowModel a class, when protocols are all the rage?**
    
    TODO
    
- **Why are DatabaseQueue.inTransaction() and DatabaseQueue.inDatabase() not reentrant?**
    
    TODO
    
- **Why must we provide query arguments in an Array, when Swift provides variadic method parameters?**
    
    TODO
