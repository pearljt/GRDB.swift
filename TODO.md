- [ ] RowModel support for implicit RowID column (see https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html)
- [ ] Fetch with a collection of primary keys: db.fetch(RowModel.type, primaryKeys:[...]). Problem: users will often want to sort, so the plain SELECT * FROM persons WHERE id IN (?,?,?) won't be appreciated. Needs more thought.
- [ ] Let Bindings eat arrays, or make it easy to generate series of ?,?,?,?
- [ ] Pierlo complains that databaseDictionary returns a dictionary of values when updateFromDatabaseRow eats a Row. See if we can do something about that.
