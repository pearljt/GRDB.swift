- [ ] FetchedRecordsController is not reactive:
    
    We need to be able to start and stop subscribing to changes made on a request. This means that diffs have to be performed between two arbitraty states of the database, not only between two transactions.
    
    And let's lift the restriction on Record: make this able to work on any fetchable type (row, record, value, optional value).
    
- [ ] Request.bound(to:adapter:) (requires adapters to be able to adapt an already adapted row)
- [ ] Think about supporting Cursor's underestimatedCount, which could speed up Array(cursor) and fetchAll()
- [ ] FetchedRecordsController: handle fetch errors
- [ ] Swift 3.0.2 (Xcode 8.2): "Type inference will properly unwrap optionals when used with generics and implicitly-unwrapped optionals." Maybe this fixes `row.value(named: "foo") as? Int`?
- [ ] Attach databases (this could be the support for fetched records controller caches). Interesting question: what happens when one attaches a non-WAL db to a databasePool?
- [ ] SQLCipher: sqlite3_rekey is discouraged (https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb/issues/547#issuecomment-259219320)
- [ ] Restore dispatching tests in GRDBOSXTests (they are disabled in order to avoid linker errors)
    - DatabasePoolReleaseMemoryTests
    - DatabasePoolSchemaCacheTests
    - DatabaseQueueReleaseMemoryTests
    - DatabasePoolBackupTests
    - DatabasePoolConcurrencyTests
    - DatabasePoolReadOnlyTests
    - DatabaseQueueConcurrencyTests
- [ ] FetchedRecordsController throttling (suggested by @hdlj)
- [ ] What is the behavior inTransaction and inSavepoint behaviors in case of commit error? Code looks like we do not rollback, leaving the app in a weird state (out of Swift transaction block with a SQLite transaction that may still be opened).
- [ ] GRDBCipher / custom SQLite builds: remove #/@available limitations
- [ ] File protection: Read https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb/issues/262 and understand https://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2012/Aug/msg00527.html
- [ ] Support for resource values (see https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1719/_index.html)
- [ ] Query builder
    - [ ] SELECT readers.*, books.* FROM ... JOIN ...
    - [ ] date functions
    - [ ] NOW/CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    - [ ] ROUND() http://marc.info/?l=sqlite-users&m=130419182719263
    - [ ] RANDOM() https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html
    - [ ] GLOB https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] REGEXP https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] CASE x WHEN w1 THEN r1 WHEN w2 THEN r2 ELSE r3 END https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html


Not sure

- [ ] Support for OR ROLLBACK, and mismatch between the Swift depth and the SQLite depth of nested transactions/savepoint:
    
    ```swift
    try db.inTransaction {           // Swift depth: 1, SQLite depth: 1
        try db.execute("COMMIT")     // Swift depth: 1, SQLite depth: 0
        try db.execute("INSERT ...") // Should throw an error since this statement is no longer protected by a transaction
        try db.execute("SELECT ...") // Should throw an error since this statement is no longer protected by a transaction
        return .commit 
    }
    ```

    ```swift
    try db.inTransaction {
        try db.execute("INSERT OR ROLLBACK ...") // throws 
        return .commit // not executed because of error
    }   // Should not ROLLBACK since transaction has already been rollbacked
    ```

    ```swift
    try db.inTransaction {
        do {
            try db.execute("INSERT OR ROLLBACK ...") // throws
        } catch {
        }
        try db.execute("INSERT ...") // Should throw an error since this statement is no longer protected by a transaction
        try db.execute("SELECT ...") // Should throw an error since this statement is no longer protected by a transaction
        return .commit
    }
    ```

    ```swift
    try db.inTransaction {
        do {
            try db.execute("INSERT OR ROLLBACK ...") // throws
        } catch {
        }
        return .commit  // Should throw an error since transaction has been rollbacked and user's intent can not be applied
    }
    ```

- [ ] Remove DatabaseValue.value()
    - [X] Don't talk about DatabaseValue.value() in README.md
- [ ] Document or deprecate DatabaseCoder
- [ ] Support for NSColor/UIColor. Beware UIColor components can go beyond [0, 1.0] in iOS10.
- [ ] Store dates as timestamp (https://twitter.com/gloparco/status/780948021613912064, https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/97)


Require changes in the Swift language:

- [ ] Specific and optimized Optional<StatementColumnConvertible>.fetch... methods when http://openradar.appspot.com/22852669 is fixed.


Requires recompilation of SQLite:

- [ ] https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/column_database_name.html could help extracting out of a row a subrow only made of columns that come from a specific table. Requires SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA which is not set on the sqlite3 lib that ships with OSX.
