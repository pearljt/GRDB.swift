- [ ] Fetch with a collection of primary keys: db.fetch(RowModel.type, primaryKeys:[...]). Problem: users will often want to sort, so the plain SELECT * FROM persons WHERE id IN (?,?,?) won't be appreciated. Needs more thought.
- [ ] Let Bindings eat arrays, or make it easy to generate series of ?,?,?,?
- [ ] Remove RowModelError.Dummy when rdar://problem/21707972 is fixed.
- [ ] Make DBDate public? Support both ISO-8601 and timestamps?
