- [ ] RowModel.reload(db)
- [ ] RowModel support for implicit RowID column (see https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html)
- [ ] db.fetch(RowModel.type, primaryKeys:[...])    // several primary keys
- [ ] Investigate INSERT OR REPLACE
- [ ] Add bindings to SQLiteError, so that one known the value that could not be updated/inserted.
- [ ] Document why execute and fetch methods will never be added to DatabaseQueue, and one always has to execute a block. It is because code like `dbQueue.execute("INSERT..."); let id = dbQueue.lastInsertedRowID` would be *unsafe*.
- [ ] Pierlo complains that databaseDictionary returns a dictionary of values when updateFromDatabaseRow eats a Row. See if we can do something about that.
