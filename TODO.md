- [ ] RowModel support for implicit RowID column (see https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html)
- [ ] db.fetch(RowModel.type, primaryKeys:[...])    // several primary keys
- [ ] Let Bindings eat arrays, or make it easy to generate series of ?,?,?,?
- [ ] Pierlo complains that databaseDictionary returns a dictionary of values when updateFromDatabaseRow eats a Row. See if we can do something about that.
- [ ] Have update statements return a result that holds (changes, lastInsertedRowID).
