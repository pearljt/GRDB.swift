- [ ] RowModel support for implicit RowID column (see https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html)
- [ ] db.fetch(RowModel.type, primaryKeys:[...])    // several primary keys
- [ ] Investigate INSERT OR REPLACE
- [ ] Add bindings to SQLiteError, so that one known the value that could not be updated/inserted.
- [ ] Pierlo complains that databaseDictionary returns a dictionary of values when updateFromDatabaseRow eats a Row. See if we can do something about that.
- [ ] Seriously question what RowModel.save() should do when primary key is set, and yet the object does not exists in the database. What does ActiveRecord do?
- [ ] RowModel.update() should return true if it actually did update something.
