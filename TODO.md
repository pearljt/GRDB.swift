- [ ] Fetch with a collection of primary keys: db.fetch(RowModel.type, primaryKeys:[...]). Problem: users will often want to sort, so the plain SELECT * FROM persons WHERE id IN (?,?,?) won't be much useful. Needs more thought.
- [ ] Let QueryArguments eat arrays, or make it easy to generate series of ?,?,?,?
- [ ] Remove RowModelError.Dummy when rdar://problem/21707972 is fixed.
- [ ] Make DBDate public? Support both ISO-8601 and timestamps? Since the format of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP is "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS", our ISO8601 formatter does not play well with date sorting :-(
- [ ] Question public access to reusable statements.
- [ ] Support for UPSERT? Check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/418898/sqlite-upsert-not-insert-or-replace
- [ ] Try to have RowModel.init() take both a row and a dictionary, if possible.
