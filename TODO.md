- [ ] #2: this commit may be how stephencelis fixed it: https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift/commit/8f64e357c3a6668c5f011c91ba33be3e8d4b88d0
- [ ] Use @warn_unused_result
- [ ] Read https://www.sqlite.org/isolation.html

- [ ] Since Records' primary key are infered, no operation is possible on the primary key unless we have a Database instance. It's impossible to define the record.primaryKey property, or to provide a copy() function that does not clone the primary key: they miss the database that is the only object aware of the primary key. Should we change our mind, and have Record explicitly expose their primary key again?
