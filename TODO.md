- [ ] #2: this commit may be how stephencelis fixed it: https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift/commit/8f64e357c3a6668c5f011c91ba33be3e8d4b88d0
- [ ] Use @warn_unused_result
- [ ] RowModel.databaseChanges. It's easy to tell which columns have changed, but difficult to tell how, because there is not always an old value. Should we return an array of changed columns instead? We only track *column changes*, not *property changes* (column "latitude" has changed, but we don't know anything about the "coordinate" property): is it a problem? What is the use case?
- [ ] What is this RowModel.copyDatabaseValuesFrom(other) crap? Don't we just need a plain regular copy() method? The trouble is the primary key: should we copy it or not? Should it be an option? What are the use cases?
- [ ] Read https://www.sqlite.org/isolation.html
- [ ] Consider renaming RowModel to Record or DatabaseRecord.
