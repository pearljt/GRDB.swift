Not sure:

- [ ] Remove explicit DatabaseQueue and DatabasePool from DatabaseMigrator:
        // before:
        try migrator.migrate(dbQueue)   
        try migrator.migrate(dbPool)
        // after:
        try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in try migrator.migrate(db) }
        try dbPool.write { db in try migrator.migrate(db) }
- [ ] Refactor errors in a single type?
- [ ] Since Records' primary key are infered, no operation is possible on the primary key unless we have a Database instance. It's impossible to define the record.primaryKey property, or to provide a copy() function that does not clone the primary key: they miss the database that is the only object aware of the primary key. Should we change our mind, and have Record explicitly expose their primary key again?
- [ ] Have Record adopt Hashable and Equatable, based on primary key. Problem: we can't do it know because we don't know the primary key until we have a database connection.
- [ ] Conversion should crash when type mismatch (Optional<String>.fetchOne(db, "SELECT 1"))


Require changes in the Swift language:

- [ ] Specific and optimized Optional<StatementColumnConvertible>.fetch... methods when http://openradar.appspot.com/22852669 is fixed.


Requires recompilation of SQLite:

- [ ] https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/column_database_name.html could help extracting out of a row a subrow only made of columns that come from a specific table. Requires SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA which is not set on the sqlite3 lib that ships with OSX.
