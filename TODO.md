- [ ] RowModel support for implicit RowID column (see https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html)

- [ ] Investigate INSERT OR REPLACE
- [ ] Add bindings to SQLiteError, so that one known the value that could not be updated/inserted.
- [ ] Pierlo complains that databaseDictionary returns a dictionary of values when updateFromDatabaseRow eats a Row. See if we can do something about that.
